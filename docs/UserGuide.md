# Calidr: User Guide

Welcome!

Calidr is a **time-management and scheduling calendar application** for university students, optimized for use via a
Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Calidr helps you
manage and store your classes, assignments, deadlines, and tasks from one place.

This guide provides detailed instructions on how to use the features of Calidr. Whether you're a new
user [getting started](#quick-start) with the basics or an experienced user looking
for [advanced tips and tricks](#paperclip-features), this guide has everything you need to know.

We recommend that you refer to the [Definitions](#mag-definitions) to familiarize yourself with the terminology used in
this guide.

If you have any questions or run into problems, check out the [FAQ](#faq) for solutions to commonly faced issues.

## :mag: Definitions

### Command definitions

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
🕮 From now on we'll be using a slightly modified version of the <a href="http://docopt.org/">docopt</a> command description language.
</div>

<details>

<ol>
<li>We will use the word &quot;<strong>string</strong>&quot; to describe any general sequence of characters.</li>
<li>We will use the word &quot;<strong>word</strong>&quot; to describe a sequence of characters terminated by a whitespace.</li>
<li><p>Words ending with a backslash <code>/</code> are interpreted as <em>compulsory</em>, <em>position-independent</em> <strong>options</strong>.</p>
<p><code>t/</code>,<code>by/</code>,<code>from/</code>,<code>to/</code></p>
</li>
<li>Uppercase words denote the position of <strong>arguments</strong>.</li>
<li><p>All other words that do not follow the above conventions are interpreted as <strong>commands</strong> and <strong>subcommands</strong>.</p>
<p><code>help</code></p>
</li>
<li><p>Options can have arguments specified after a whitespace. Together they are refered to as a <strong>field</strong>.</p>
<p><code>todo t/ &lt;title&gt; by/ &lt;date-time&gt;</code></p>
</li>
<li><p>An option&#39;s arguments, when bracketed by &quot;&lt;&quot; and &quot;&gt;&quot;, can be <strong>whitespace-containing</strong> strings. They are terminated
by a newline or a different option, matching <em>leftmost-first</em></p>
<p><code>event t/ &lt;title&gt; from/ &lt;start-date-time&gt; to/ &lt;end-date-time&gt;</code></p>
</li>
<li><p>Else, if the arguments are in uppercase, they must be <strong>strictly words</strong> terminated by whitespace</p>
<p><code>delete TASK_INDEX</code></p>
</li>
<li><p>Some commands may accept a single <em>positional</em> argument string, known as a <strong>main argument</strong>, beginning after a
whitespace following the command itself and terminating at a newline or the first option, matching <em>leftmost-first</em>.</p>
<p><code>edit TASK_INDEX t/ &lt;title&gt;</code></p>
</li>
<li><p>Options (and arguments) bracketed with &quot;[&quot; and  &quot;]&quot; are <strong>optional</strong>.</p>
<p><code>[d/ &lt;description&gt;] [p/ &lt;priority&gt;]</code></p>
</li>
<li><p>Ellipsis &quot;...&quot; specify that the argument (or field) to the left could be <strong>repeated</strong> multiple times:</p>
<p><code>[tag/ &lt;tag&gt;]...</code></p>
</li>
<li><p><em>All elements are required by default</em>, if not included in brackets &quot;[ ]&quot;. However, sometimes it is necessary to
mark elements as <strong>required</strong> explicitly with parentheses &quot;( )&quot;. For example, when you need to group
mutually-inclusive elements (if <em>one</em> element is present, then <em>another</em> one is required):</p>
<p><code>edit TASK_INDEX (OPTION &lt;argument&gt;)...</code></p>
</li>
</ol>
</details>


### Data terminology

1. Elements on a calendar are referred to as **Tasks**.
2. Tasks must have a *unique* **title**.
3. A task can have an optional **description**, **location**, and multiple **tags(s)**.
4. Tasks have an associated **priority**.
    1. Priority is one of `HIGH`, `MEDIUM` or `LOW`.
    3. Tasks have a default priority of `MEDIUM`.
5. Tasks must either be **ToDos** or **Events**.
    1. ToDos have a single associated **date-time** (e.g. a due date).
        1. ToDos also have an associated **status**.
            1. Status is one of `DONE` or `NOT DONE`.
            1. ToDos have a default status of `NOT DONE`.
    2. Events have *two* associated date-times (e.g a start and end-date).
6. Dates are specified in the format `DD-MM-YYYY`. Date-times are specified in the format `DD-MM-YYYY HHMM`. Calidr also
   accepts and automatically parser the following keywords as date-times:

   `today`, `tomorrow`, `next week`, `next month`, `next year`
<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
🕮 If the date-time you provide is a little off, Calidr will still try its best to parse it. For instance, the time <code>2400</code> will automatically resolve to <code>0000</code> the next day, and <code>29-02-2023</code> will automatically resolve to <code>28-02-2023</code> as 2023 is not a leap year.
</div>

7. Tasks are uniquely identified by their **task index**. This is given in the [list panel](#ui-terminology), and is also used to refer to
   tasks in commands.

### UI terminology

![Ui](images/Ui_annotated.png)

1. **Command box**

   The command box is where you can type in commands to Calidr. Pressing `Enter` will execute the
   command.

1. **Calendar panel**

   The calendar panel is where you can view your tasks graphically. Tasks are displayed as coloured
   blocks, with green being **ToDos** and blue being **Events**. High priority tasks have a light pink background, low priority tasks are in italics, and marked tasks are translucent. The calendar panel also displays the _focused_ date and
   time, which [may not be the current time](#viewing-a-different-date-view).

    
<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
🕮 The calendar panel comes in <a href="#switching-to-a-different-layout--page">several layouts</a>. If you'd prefer to stick to the keyboard, you can scroll the different layouts using the <code>up</code> and <code>down</code> arrow keys. 
</div>

1. **List panel**

   The list panel is where Calidr will display a list of the _current selection_ of tasks, along with their [task index](#data-terminology), available to commands. This usually
   just shows all the tasks in the calendar, unless you just tried to [filtering tasks by title](#searching-and-filtering-for-tasks-search).

1. **Result panel**

   The result panel is where Calidr will display the result of your command, including any errors.

## :paperclip: Features

### Searching and filtering for tasks: `search`

Searches for tasks with matching keywords in their fields. The [list panel](#ui-terminology) is updated to show only filtered tasks.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
🕮 
<ul>
<li>Keyword matching is case-insensitive</li>
    <li>All tasks whose titles have any of the given keywords will be displayed in the list.</li>
    <li>You can only run commands on tasks currently displayed in the list panel.</li>
    <li>If there are no matches, all tasks are displayed.</li>
    <li>To manually clear your filter/reset the list panel, run the command without any parameters: <code>search</code></li>
</ul>    
</div>

Format: `search [KEYWORD]...`

Examples:

- `search book`
- `search assignment homework`
- `search`: Displays all tasks.

### Deleting a task: `delete`

`edit 4 from/ 05-03-2023 2000 to/ 06-03-2023 2000`

### Switching to a different layout: `page`

By default, the [calendar panel](#ui-terminology) is displayed in a monthly-layout. A weekly or daily-layout is supported if you wish to
view more or less tasks.

Format: `page LAYOUT`, where `LAYOUT` is one of `month`, `week`, or `day`.

![A comparison of the three layouts](images/Ui_pages.png)

Example: `page week`

#### Viewing a different date: `view`

By default, the [calendar panel](#ui-terminology) is focused on the current date. When you wish to view a different month, week or day, you
can use the `view` command.

Format: `view <date-time>`.

Example:

- `view 01-03-2023`
- `view next week`

### Showing all the details of a task: `show`

The GUI displays a condensed representation of tasks in both the [calendar and list panels](#ui-terminology). This commmand shows all the
details of a particular task, including its description, location and tags, in a pop-up dialog.

Format: `show TASK_INDEX`

Example: `show 2`

## Other

### Saving your data

Calidr user preferences and calendar information is saved in the hard disk automatically after any modification command.
The calendar data is stored
as an [ics file](https://www.ical4j.org/). This data is compatible with any application that uses the ics format.


### Editing the data file

The `calendar.ics` save file is located in the `data` folder the directory the program resides in (
i.e. `[root_directory]/data/calendar.ics`). Advanced
users are welcome to manipulate data directly by editing the save file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
Note that if other applications uses ICS fields not set by Calindr, the app will ignore them, but work correctly otherwise.
However, if your changes to the save file makes its format invalid, Calidr will discard all data and start with an empty data file the next time it's run.
</div>


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data files it creates with the file that contains
the data of your previous Calidr home directory.
